## Microfrontend Architecture

This project is built using a **microfrontend architecture** to promote modularity and enable scalable, independent development of each feature. Below is an overview of how we have structured and integrated the microfrontends.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Main Container Application**  
   Acts as the shell for the entire application. It manages the routing, global state, and integrates individual microfrontend modules.

2. **Independent Microfrontend Modules**  
   Each feature is built as a standalone module (or microfrontend) with its own codebase. Each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, allowing for flexible scaling and faster iteration cycles.

3. **Shared Libraries and Components**  
   Reusable components like headers, footers, and UI elements, as well as libraries such as `React`, `Tailwind CSS`, and `Redux`, are maintained in a shared library, ensuring consistency across all modules.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React (for each microfrontend and the main container)
- **Integration Tool**: Webpack Module Federation (allows independent deployment and loading of microfrontends)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit (for global state sharing)
